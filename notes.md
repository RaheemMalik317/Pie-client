-useState always accepts two values:
    the state variable that's based upon the intital value we pass into it - in this case, undefined
- a function defined as setSessionToken. setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of our state variable

-naming convention for state variables is always what our state varible is called, and then 'set'___

Naming convention for componenets is to start with a Capital letter
